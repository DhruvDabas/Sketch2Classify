# Sketch2Classify

<p>Sketch2Classify is a machine learning application that can classify handwritten words and digits . Users can draw to a digit on a dashboard and predict in real-time. The project is built using Python and Pytorch </p>

<h2>Features </h2>
Character Dashboard: Users can draw any character (digit, letter, or even short words) on the interface, and the app will predict the input using a trained model.
Real-time Predictions: The dashboard provides quick predictions for drawn characters and words using a pre-trained machine learning model.
