# Sketch2Num

<p>Sketch2Num is a machine learning application that can classify handwritten digits. Users can either draw a digit on a dashboard, or present a number to the app through their camera, and the app will predict the digit in real-time. The project is built using Python and scikit-learn. </p>

## Features
<ul> Digit Dashboard: Users can draw any digit (0-9) on the interface, and the app will predict what number it is. </ul>
<ul> Camera-based Recognition: Users can show a handwritten or printed number to their camera, and the app will classify it using the trained model. </ul>
<ul> Real-time Predictions: Both dashboard and camera-based recognition provide quick predictions using a pre-trained machine learning model. </ul>

## Tech Stack
<ul> Language: Python </ul>
Libraries:
<ul> scikit-learn for model training and digit recognition </ul>
<ul> OpenCV for camera integration </ul>
<ul> Tkinter </ul>
<ul> Model: Pre-trained on the MNIST dataset </ul>
